Image Segmentation of Embryos
CS 179 Final Project
Spring 2025
Jena Alsup


- Installation and usage instructions
cd build
cmake ..
make -j10
./cpu_segmentation (for the cpu version)
./gpu_segmentation (for the gpu version - not implemented yet)
./cpu_tests (to run the cpu tests)


- Project description and features
GPU-accelerated image segmentation on biological microscopy images of cells.
Segmentation enables the quantification of cell count, cell shape, tissue thickness, and a 3D reconstruction of the structure.
The implemented algorithm for segmentation includes 3 steps:
1. Gaussian blur: Each thread computes an average of neighboring pixels
2. Thresholding: Computes optimal threshold to binarize the image and binarizes it
3. Labeling Components: Assign a unique label (eg 1, 2, 3, 4) to each nuclei / structure identified in the image


- Expected results and screenshots
inputs in /data. resulting images in /outputs. Given a 2d slice of an embryo, we expect each of the nuclei to be outlined and numbered. We have 3 input and their resulting outputs.



- Performance analysis comparing CPU and GPU versions
CPU Times:
- 512x512:
- 1024x1024:
- 2048x2048: 
GPU Times:
- 512x512:
- 1024x1024:
- 2048x2048: 


- Potential improvements
Add more steps to the algorithm to make it more accurate. For example, despeckling, a more advanced thresholding method, edge smoothing, etc. This would make the algorihtm more generalizable to all microscopy images of embryos, as the current approach was potentially overfitted to just work well on the sample images.
