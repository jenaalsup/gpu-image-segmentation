Project Description and Features
------------------------------------------------------------

This project implements GPU-accelerated image segmentation for biological microscopy images of cells using CUDA.
Segmentation enables:
- Quantification of cell count, cell shape, and tissue thickness
- 3D reconstruction of biological structures

The segmentation algorithm includes the following steps:

1. Gaussian Blur  
   Each thread computes an average of neighboring pixels.

2. Thresholding  
   Computes an optimal threshold to binarize the image.

3. Labeling Components  
   Assigns a unique label (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) to each nucleus/structure identified in the image.

------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Results and Screenshots
------------------------------------------------------------

- Input images are located in the /data folder
- Output results are saved to the /outputs folder
- Given a 2D slice of an embryo, each nucleus should be outlined and numbered in the resulting image
- The dataset includes 3 input images of different sizes (512, 1024, 2048) and their corresponding outputs

Performance Analysis: CPU vs. GPU
------------------------------------------------------------

CPU Times  (Benchmark)
- 512×512: 595 ms
- 1024×1024: 2353 ms 
- 2048×2048: 10291 ms

GPU Times  
- 512×512: 364 ms
- 1024×1024: 97 ms
- 2048×2048: 356 ms

The GPU significantly sped up the segmentation time. Note that for a smaller 512x512 image, using a GPU is not as beneficial because GPU acceleration requires much overhead that doesn't scale down with smaller images.

------------------------------------------------------------
Potential Improvements
------------------------------------------------------------

- Add more stages to enhance segmentation accuracy:
  - Despeckling
  - Advanced thresholding methods
  - Edge smoothing
- These improvements would help generalize the algorithm to a broader range of microscopy images, as the current implementation may be overfitted to the sample dataset, and doesn't work as well on the 2048x2048 image where the nuclei appear smaller.
